        <h1>Hello Friends, My Name is Emma!</h1>

        <p>For as long as I can remember, I have loved being in the kitchen. Cooking and baking have become my way of coping with life’s challenges and finding joy in the beauty simple ingredients can make. Food has a way of bringing us all together, and I am so glad you’re here. </p>
        <p>My husband, Nicholas and I have been married for a little over a year. We are both college students at BYU-I. I am studying food science and Nicholas is studying software engineering. Nicholas is my number one fan and is such a good sport when it comes to my many dishes and the flour messes I make all over our kitchen. </p>
